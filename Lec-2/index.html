                Our solar system was formed about <em> 4.5 billion years </em> ago! But <small>what exactly is the solar system? </small>
                It consists of our sun and eight <strong> main planets: </strong> Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. <del> There are also moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, rocks and dust. </del>

                <i> All of the planets in the solar system orbit the sun.</i> 
                Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are called <b> 'terrestrial planets' </b>. 
                They are mostly <ins> made of rock and metal.</ins> 
                Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are called <b>'gas giants'</b>. 
                They are mostly <ins> composed of gas and they have rings.</ins>
                The smallest planet is Mercury and the biggest is Jupiter. 
                Neptune is the coldest and <u>Venus is the hottest planet.</u>
                <br>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the <mark> second-smallest planet </mark> in the Solar System. 
                Mars is a terrestrial planet with polar heat caps of hot water (H<sub>2</sub>O )and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
